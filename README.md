Email Validator
===============

This is a simple to use email address validator for Objective-C.  It will work
on OSX and iOS.  It aims to achieve a higher level of accuracy when validating
email addresses than a naive regex validator.


Usage
-----

Copy the two SZEmailValidator files into your Xcode project.  Pass the email
address you want to validate as an NSString to the [SZEmailValidator isValid:]
method.


Requirements
------------

Xcode.
